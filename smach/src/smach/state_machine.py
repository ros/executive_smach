    This is a finite state machine smach container. Note that though this is
    a state machine, it also implements the L{smach.State}
    interface, so these can be composed hierarchically, if such a pattern is
    desired.

    States are added to the state machine as 3-tuple specifications:
     - label
     - state instance
     - transitions

    The label is a string, the state instance is any class that implements the
    L{smach.State} interface, and transitions is a dictionary mapping strings onto
    strings which represent the transitions out of this new state. Transitions
    can take one of three forms:
     - OUTCOME -> STATE_LABEL
     - OUTCOME -> None (or unspecified)
     - OUTCOME -> SM_OUTCOME
